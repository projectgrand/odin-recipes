# odin-recipes


Hello! This is you from the past. You have started your journey down the road of code. 
Things still look bright ahead as of writing this, but we know storms come in fast...

Anyway, this is your first project: Recipes.

"It’s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished but it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS." -Directly from the mouth of Odin's horse.
