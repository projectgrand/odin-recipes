    <h2>Description</h2>
   
    <p>Korean Beef Bowl is a dish from my girlfriend's from before we started dating. It is now a staple of my diet. I've added a few alterations to the original recipe.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 Cup Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tsp Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>1/2 Tsp Crushed Red-Pepper Flakes</li>
        <li>1/4 Tsp Ground Ginger</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>3 Cloves Garlic</li>
        <li>1lb Ground Beef</li>
        <li>2 Green Onions, Thinly Sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 Tsp Sesame Seeds</li>
        <li>1 Cup Rice, Cooked on stove or Rice Cooker</li>
        <li>2 Zucchini, Pealed and Chopped</li>
        <li>3 Carrots, Chopped</li>
        <li>1 Onion, Chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
       
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Make sure rice is cooking separately in either a pot or rice cooker.</li>
        <li>Add chopped, zucchini, carrot, and onion. Cook until crunchy, 10-12 minutes. Remove from pan.</li>
         <li>In a small bowl, whisk together brown sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, red pepper flakes and ginger.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef to pan that previously had the vegetables and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in soy sauce mixture and green onions until well combined, allowing to simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately over rice and vegetables, garnished with green onion and sesame seeds, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
